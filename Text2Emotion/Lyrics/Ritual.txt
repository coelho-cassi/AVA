Tonight, we're summoned for a divine cause
Remembrance, no, but for their future loss
This chapel of ritual
Smells of dead human sacrifices form the altar...
Beduins and Nomads
Carried through the times
Through pestilences and famines
These ancient scrolls of rhymes
Our fallen angel vexed
Was banished from the sky
Recite now, from the text
And pray for all to die
This chapel of ritual
Smells of dead human sacrifices from the altar bed
You sing it Frisco, yeah
On this night of ritual, invoking our master
To procreate the unholy bastard
Our father, who art in Hell
Unhallowed, be thy name
Cursed be thy sons and daughters
Of our nemesis who are to blame
Thy kingdom come, Nema
Tonight, we summoned for his unholy friend
Now celebrate the end
This chapel of ritual
Smells of dead human sacrifices from the altar bed
Come on!
On this night of ritual, invoking our master
To procreate the unholy bastard
Thank you San Francisco!
You do understand that we're not done, right?
Do you honestly believe that we'll leave you the shitty ending like that?
We do not believe in shitty endings you know?
You seem to believe in happy endings
I want you to promise yourselves and me
That tonight you will go home
Give either yourself and/or someone due to or close to you
An orgasm tonight
Will you promise me that?
That's good!
We're gonna do one last song now
Called incidentally this song is about happy endings
Specifically how could she, one female happy ending,
In slightly overcomplicated however ritualistic way
But before we let you go
Will you sing loud and clear a song to celebrate the female orgasm
In the name of Satan
