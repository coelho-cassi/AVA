He was born in Oklahoma
His wife's name is Betty Jo Thelma Liz
He's not responsible for what he's doin'
His mother made him what he is

And it's up against the wall, redneck mother
Mother who has raised her son so well
He's thirty-four and drinkin' in them honky tonks
Just kickin' hippies' asses and raisin' hell

Well, you know, he sure likes to drink that Lone Star beer
And he chases it down with Wild Turkey bourbon liquor
He's got a '57 GMC pickup truck
With a gun rack and "I'd rather be a roper than a doper" bumper sticker

And it's up against the wall, redneck mother
Mother who has raised her son so well
He's thirty-four and drinkin' in them honky tonks
Just kickin' hippies' asses and raisin' hell

M is for the mud flaps she gave me for my pickup truck
O is for the oil I put in my pickup truck, drain it out, and dip my sheep in it
T is for Dolly Parton
H is for Haggard
E is for Eggs
R is for Redneck

It's up against the wall, redneck mother
Mother who has raised her son so well
He's thirty-four and drinkin' in them honky tonks
Kickin' hippies' asses and raisin' hell

Well, it's up against the wall, redneck mother
Mother who has raised her son so well
He's thirty-four and drinkin' in them honky tonks
He's just kickin' hippies' asses and raisin' hell
He's just kickin' hippies' asses and raisin' hell
In Muskogee, Oklahoma, U-S-A
