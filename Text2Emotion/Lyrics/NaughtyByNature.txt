Come on, come on, have a ball if you act maturely
Ayo, who wanna get invited to a Burna party?
I got a hunnid and eighteen homies who's naughty
So, baby, don't you bring your friends if those chicks are corny
We gets it on 'til the dawn, 'til they say, "This is ridiculous"
Ladies, they love the way we come through in the clutch
Fellas who can't keep up, might as well hit the dust
And haters, bump what they say, they don't mean shhâ€”
Yo, I give three words when I try to scoop her
Then after that, ain't got no time for no party pooper
I keeps it movin' 'cause we zone out and own our own damn lane
Thirty years up in this same game, still doing our damn thang
Heard I'm a earner, had to earn a burner
Trigga nigga, Naughty Nation, Marshal Arsenal
Never had to use burner-burners
I'm a changed man, still on the gun range
Singing karaoke, wife wearing Dolce
Black fist, pick stuck in my gold teeth
Been winning, befriending woman
From the beginning with a dripping driver
African emblems on the engine, engine, engine
A number runner, every summer, what's hopping with ya option?
Keep it gutter witcha brother
Hey I wanna see fine keles, come jam for me
Not the ones, wey dey form Instagram for me
Say God damn you no go fiti, handle me
God go punish, whoever no gbadun me
Because I know that I'm the bigger man
It's why I came looking fresher than a peppermint (uh)
'Til today I dey the same because I can't change
I be naughty by nature, I be gang-gang
Some people think it's a game, like connect four
'Til I rise the ting and dem collect four
I come extort
Give me both, mine and yours
Silent war
'Cause anyone could be next door
I was born naughty by nature
Now I make more
But still me wicked as they come
Your eyes get sore
Why you watch my pockets for?
Watch it (hmm)
Spaceship Rocket Boys
Runner by nature
Know that shawty bang-bang
New Jerusalem, Africa the same game
Boom bap, boom baye, all the same slang
No protection, no peace, they know the chain game
Bang, bang
