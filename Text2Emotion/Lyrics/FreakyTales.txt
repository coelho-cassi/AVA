These are the tales, the freaky tales

She loved the way I rocked on the microphone
When I met Joan, I took her home

All she wanted was to freak with a man

You can break yourself but you can't break me
You never met a player like $hort, baby"
I knew a dick sucker named Betty-Jo
Took her to my house and we did it on the floor
The girl got freaky and I'll tell you more

Everythin' she had is what I get
'Cause I'm Too $hort, baby, I don't play that shit
I met another freak, her name was Rita

I told her like this, she can suck my peter
Or even go home 'cause I knew I didn't need her
Scratched her name off my telephone book
Never again, I took a second look
'Cause the next young freak, her name was Sharon
She kept lookin', well, I kept starin'

Her booty was stuffed in the jeans she was wearin'
She never left, he cut out

If you saw baby, you'd like this girlie

Shirley was freakin' like a girl named Rachel
Her bite was vicious and it sure was fatal
She liked to kiss all on my naval
Those are her lips on top of my label
I knew another freak, her name was Candy
Real big lips and they came in handy
I smooth got worked and it was so dandy
I hooked the broad up with my homeboy Randy
He did me a favor in return
Gave me a lizard, said her name was Laverne
Baby got tossed, then I got on
I grabbed the microphone and started singing my song
My young homeboy heard me rap
And said he had way more freaks than that
So I told him like this, they might be freakin'
But, boy, you never had that TP treatment
