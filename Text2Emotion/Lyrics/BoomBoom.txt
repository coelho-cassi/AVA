Ah boom, boom, boom, boom
I'm gonna shoot you down
Right off 'a your feet
Until you're home with me
Put ya in my house
Boom, boom, boom, boom
I love the way you walk
Especially how you talk
'Cause when you whisper in my ear
And say "Johnny I love you"
I love that talk
Oh when you talk that talk
But you knock me dead
Right off my feet
I took ya home with me
And put ya in my house
How, how, how, how
How, how, how how
Hey, hey
Ohh you are cookin'
Like a chip off the ol' block
Oh when you walk that walk
And talk that talk
And whisper in my ear
And say, "Johnny I love you"
I love that talk
Ah that baby talk
And I like the way you dance
And when you make romance
I was wonderin' if I
If I could have a chance
I just love the way ya walk
And when ya talk that talk
You knock me dead
Right offa my feet
I take ya home with me
Put ya in my house
Boom, boom, boom, boom
How, how, how, how
Hey, hey

Walk that walk
Talk that talk
C'mon
