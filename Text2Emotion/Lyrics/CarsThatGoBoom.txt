So many kinds, where can we start?
We like them dumb, and we like them smart
I like the ones with the pretty eyes
Well, I like all kinds of guys
Stop
What happened?
How about the ones we especially like?
Which ones?
You know the ones with the cars that go...
I hear you
Hit it!
It was me and the possy with Bunny D
We were cruising in the Jag' or the Lamborghini
When lo and behold, there appeared a mirage
He was hooking up a car in his daddy's garage
We stopped short, did a double take
He was looking so fly, I thought I wasn't awake
He was obviously hooking up bass, I assume
But then he turned a little button and the car went boom
We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We're Tigra and Bunny, and we like the boom
We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We're Tigra and Bunny, and we like the boom
We like them short, and we like them tall
We like them one, and we like them all
They're always adding speakers when they find the room
'Cause they know we love the guys with the cars that go boom
And see, my boyfriend really knows where it's at
He's got 50-inch woofers all along the back
He makes a comment on going to my room
But I'd rather stay out with his car that goes boom
We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We're Tigra and Bunny, and we like the boom
We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We're Tigra and Bunny, and we like the boom
Now if your car ain't got it, go out and get it
We like the boom, and don't you forget it
So turn down the treble, and flaunt your bass
So your car can be heard almost any place
'Cause when you're in the street, you can't go far
Without hearing the boom pouring out your car
So if your speaker's weak, then please turn it off
'Cause we like the cars that sound so tough
We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We're Tigra and Bunny, and we like the boom
We like the cars, the cars that go boom
We're Tigra and Bunny, and we like the boom
Everybody just beep your horn
Everybody just beep your horn if you hear us
Everybody just beep your horn
Just beep your horn
Now clap!
Hit it!
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep! (Come on everybody!)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep! (Come on everybody!)
Beep
Okay, beep
Beep a little louder if you hear us
I said, beep a little harder if you hear us
