Summertime
And the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin'
And the cotton, the cotton is high
Oh, your daddy, he's rich
And your ma', she's good lookin'
So hush, little baby
Don't you cry
One of these mornings
You're gonna rise up singing
You gonna spread your wings
And take, and take to the sky
Until that morning
Ain't nothing can harm you
With daddy (daddy) and mammy (mammy) standing by (oh, standing by)
Standing by
Standing by, little baby
Standing by
