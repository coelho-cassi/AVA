Yeah, I wish
I was a catfish
Swimmin in a oh, deep, blue sea
I'd have all you pretty women,
Fishin after me, fishin after me, fishin after me yeah
Well, I'm broke and I'm hungry
Well, I'm Ragged and I'm dirty too
If I clean up now baby
Can I come home with you
Come home with you, yeah
Come home with you
If you don't let me in
Can I lay 'round your door
Yeah, I'll leave so early baby
Your man won't know, your man won't know, your man won't know
Yeah, I love
I love my baby
Yeah, she's gone, scream and shout
When my train comes rollin' in
And I come rollin' out
Come rollin' out
Come rollin' out
Yeah, I'm leavin'
I'm leavin' you baby
And your crying won't make me stay
Yeah, the more you cry, baby
Further I'll go away
Further I'll go away
Further I'll go away
And I know, I know you don't want me
Yeah, I wanted you darlin'
You tell me so
Well you ain't got to worry about me
Hangin' round' no more
Hangin' round' no more
Hangin' round' no more
