I sold the farm to take my woman where she longed to be
We left our kin and all our friends back there in Tennessee
Bought those one way tickets she had often begged me for
And they took us to the streets of Baltimore
Her heart was filled with laughter when she saw those city lights
And she said, "The prettiest place on earth is Baltimore at night"
Well, a man feels proud to give his woman what she's longing for
And I kind of liked the streets of Baltimore
Got myself a factory job, I ran an old machine
Bought a little cottage in a neighborhood serene
Every night when I came home with every muscle sore
She would drag me through the streets of Baltimore
Well, I did my best to bring her back to what she used to be
But I soon learned she loved those bright lights more than she loved me
Now I'm a goin' back on that same train that brought me here before
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore
Yeah, now my baby walks the streets of Baltimore
