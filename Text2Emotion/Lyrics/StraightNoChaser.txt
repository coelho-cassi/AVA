Always be there face I live with
Always be there face I live with
Abscess memory with broken fingers
All the fallen down angels raw pain distress
It's all
In the way we know that we could have it all
Some
Satellites of pain can't always be ignored
War on all sides
War on all sides
Drink life as it comes straight no chaser
Life as it comes straight no chaser
Climb inside you away from strangers
Building a system of alleys and motorways
It's all
In the way we know
We could have it all
Some
Satellites of pain can't always be ignored
It's all in the face of what we thought we knew before
War on all sides
War on all sides
War on all sides
Keep on driving hair left morning wet
There's nothing like losing you
There's nothing like losing you
There's nothing like losing you
There's nothing like losing you
