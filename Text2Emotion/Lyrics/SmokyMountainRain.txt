I thumb my way from L.A. back to Knoxville.
I found out those bright lights ain't where I belong.
From a phone booth in the rain I called to tell her, I've had a change of dreams I'm coming home.
But the tears filled my eyes when I found out she was gone.
Smoky Mountain rain keeps on falling, I'll keep on calling her name.
Smoky Mountain rain, I'll keep on searching, I can't go on hurting this way.
She's somewhere in this Smoky Mountain rain.
I can't blame her for letting go, a woman needs someone warm to hold. Feel the
rain running down my face, I'll find her no matter what it takes.
I waved a diesel down outside a cafe, said he was going as far as Gatlinburg.
I climbed in the cab all wet and cold and lonely.
I wiped my eyes and told him about her.
I've got to find her, Can you make these big wheels burn.
smoky Mountain rain keeps on falling
I'll keep on calling her name.
Smoky Mountain rain, I'll keep on searching
I can't go on hurting this way.
She's somewhere in the Smoky Mountain rain.
