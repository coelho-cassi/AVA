Tonight I'm feeling sexy
I can make you overdose
Make it overflow, if you let me
Like a river, my waterfalls'll breakdown and let
You gon' get soaked, so bring a raincoat
When we finish you gone see a rainbow (Oh)
Come swim in my waters like a sailboat
You just making love to me like Nemo
Come sip on it, as I drip on it
You gon' have to change my name to H2O
You love it when I call your name
Daddy, daddy
You love it when I make it rain
Daddy, daddy
Storms will come
Make me overflow (Make me overflow)
Can you stand the rain?
When we get done
I still want some more (I still want some more)
Can you make it rain?
I can get it wetter than a thunderstorm (Hey)
Make love from the midnight 'til the early morn' (Eh-hey-ay)
Wakin' you up like some Folgers in your cup
That morning brew, that's what I do (Ay)
Baby can you swim deep? (Swim deep)
Diving in the ocean
While you in the sheets (In the sheets, woah)
What stroke do you got for me?
You know I'm trying to drown you (Oh)
You love it when I call your name
Daddy, daddy
You love it when I make it rain
Daddy, daddy
Storms will come
Make me overflow (Make me overflow)
Can you stand the rain? (Yeah, yeah)
When we get done (We get done)
I still want some more (I still want some more)
Can you make it rain? (Can you make it rain, yeah-hey)
Every time you pull up, boy it's a tidal wave
Ooh, she get wetter, we drip the night away
Boy it ain't no rush, take your time with me
Boy I love when you keep it right there
No, don't ever, ever stop
I'm gon' ride, baby it's you and I
Through the good and bad, I'ma be your ride or die
And when the storm comes, and the rain falls
We'll be making love, we'll be making love
Storms will come
Make me overflow (Can you stand the rain, yeah)
Can you stand the rain? (Oh, oh, can you stand the rain)
When we get done (Get done, yeah)
I still want some more (I still want some more, yeah)
Can you make it rain? (Make it rain, yeah)
