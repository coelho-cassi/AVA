I've seen men look at her before
And they think, I don't see them
I'd like to think, it makes me proud
But I'm only foolin' me
I know she'll be lookin' back
The minute I'm not there
While she pours herself on some stranger
I pour myself a drink somewhere
She's actin' single
I'm drinkin' doubles
I hide my pain
I drown my troubles
My heart is breaking
Like the tiny bubbles
She's actin' single
I'm drinkin' doubles
I know what she plans to do
But I don't know where or when
If I ask, who that stranger was
She'll just say, an old friend
I'm not weak, I tell myself
I stay because I'm strong
The truth is, I'm not man enough
To stop her from doin' me wrong
She's actin' single
I'm drinkin' doubles
I hide my pain
I drown my troubles
My heart is breakin'
Like the tiny bubbles
She's actin' single
I'm drinkin' doubles
She's actin' single
I'm drinkin' doubles
I hide my pain
